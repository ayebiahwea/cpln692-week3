    # Lab 1, Part 4 â€” Stretch Goal: Project Euler

    ## Introduction

    Practice your Javascript and math skills by solving a problem on Project
    Euler. Project Euler is a series of challenging math and computer science
    problems that can be solved using any language (for our class, use
    Javascript).

    Solve the first problem on this page https://projecteuler.net/archives
    (Multiples of 3 and 5). To check your answer, create an account and you will
    be able to submit your final result.


\\problem 1. If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000


    ===================== */
    var sum = 0;
    for (var i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
      if (i % 3 === 0 || i % 5 === 0) {
        sum += i;
      }
    }
    console.log('Sum: %d', sum);
    /* =====================


\\ problem 2
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.



    ===================== */

    var Fibonacci = [];
    Fibonacci[0] = 1;
    Fibonacci[1] = 2;
    for(i=2; i<=50; i++) {
  Fibonacci[i] = Fibonacci[i-2] + Fibonacci[i-1];
  Fibonacci.push(Fibonacci[i]);
}
Under4million = [];
for (var i = 0; i < Fibonacci.length; i++) {
  if (Fibonacci[i] <= 4000000 && Fibonacci[i] %2 == 0) {
    Under4million.push(Fibonacci[i]);
  }
}
let FibonacciSum = Under4million.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
console.log(FibonacciSum);
    /* =====================

    End code
